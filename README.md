I was working on the UTK Dataset and I been through many datasets full of images in different folders which requires a lot of data cleaning and preprocessing.
So I tried to create this dataset in a more simplified manner keeping all the data in the form of a CSV and making it available to everyone.

Content
This dataset includes a CSV of facial images that are labeled on the basis of age, gender, and ethnicity.
The dataset includes 27305 rows and 5 columns.

Acknowledgements
I downloaded the initial jpeg files from Kaggle

Inspiration
I hope many people use this dataset to create good CNN architectures in future (also it would help me learn more of deep learning too)
PEACE!
